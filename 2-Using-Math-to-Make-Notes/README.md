# 2 - Using Math to Make Notes

In this sketch we do some math with the X and Y coordinates of the mouse in order to create a grid of notes. Some HTML and CSS provide a visual representation of what's going on.

This sketch introduces the `mtof` function, which allows us to work with MIDI notation (notes in the range 0 - 127) and convert that to frequency. You can read more about MIDI notation and the formula for conversion here: [_Note names, MIDI numbers and frequencies_](http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/notes.html).
